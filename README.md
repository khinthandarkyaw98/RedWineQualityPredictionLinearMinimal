# RedWineQualityPredictionLinearMinimal

Insurance cost prediction using linear regression

In this assignment we're going to use information like Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphate, alcohol  to predict quality of wine (score between 0 and 10). The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
